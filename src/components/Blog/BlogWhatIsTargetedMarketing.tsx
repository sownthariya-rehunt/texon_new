                    By making CRM a core part of their advertising and digital

                  <p>
                  Targeted marketing, by definition, is the strategy of tailoring and personalizing online advertising according to data acquired from some intended audience.
        
                  In other words, instead of sending out ads to an incredibly large audience, a subset is selected based on their traits, interests, and preferences.
                  </p>
                  <br></br>
                  <p>Of course, targeted marketing has numerous associated benefits. After all, you’re basically sending advertisements to people who are highly likely to be interested in them. It’s hard to fail such a strategy.
                 
                  In fact, targeted marketing is the preferred strategy by consumers. When allowed to pick between random or targeted advertisements, over 40% prefer the latter, and 27.6% prefer either.</p>
                 
                  <p>Additionally, behavioral-data-based ads were shown to be the most effective – their clickthrough rate was up to 5.3x higher when compared to other approaches.</p>

                  As mentioned previously, all targeted marketing relies on segmentation. Audiences are separated according to specific criteria, and advertisements are tailored to each. Of course, with enough data, the audiences can become extremely detailed and narrow. However, it is often recommended to avoid hyper-targeted marketing.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                  Market and customer segmentation can be approached in a multitude of ways. However, there are three primary ways to split audiences. Marketers and business owners should create segments based on demographics, geographics, and psychographics.
                  </p>
                 
                  <h2>Targeted Marketing Strategies and Examples</h2>
                  <p>
                  Before we get into the particularly targeted marketing strategies, one important thing to note is that all strategies depend on data. If you can’t acquire lots of in-depth data on your target audience or are lacking in the analytics department, targeted marketing will be significantly harder.

                  <h3>Targeted Email Marketing</h3>
                  <p>
                  When it comes to online marketing, emails are an essential part of the process. In fact, companies will often begin their targeted marketing campaign by considering the email channel first.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                  Like all other approaches to targeted marketing, campaigns begin with email list segmentation. You can’t send highly targeted messages if the audience isn’t separated according to certain criteria. That’s where data will come in.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                  If you run an e-commerce store, some of your shoppers might prefer a particular type, color, or size of the product. Gathering data on all these preferences will allow you to build highly targeted messages for each segment, which will, of course, result in more and better leads.

                  <h3>Targeted SMS Marketing</h3>
                  <p>
                  Targeted SMS marketing is really no different from all the other strategies. However, it might be significantly more effective than many other marketing channels. We have described the incredible effectiveness of SMS campaigns in our previous articles.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                  Yet, it would be most efficient to build a consistent user profile from data acquired in email marketing (and other channels). SMS marketing is not as conducive to producing data as there’s barely any tracking available for it.Additionally, it’s usually a very responsive and quick channel, which might skew certain datasets (e.g. shopping behavior might be different, but the differences might be due to the channel itself, not the users).
                  </p>
                  <p>
                  Of course, targeting users with SMS marketing is a boon to many industries. One of the few industries where it’s most effective is ecommerce and retail. As the industries have a ton of data on customers, they can create custom, tailored SMS messages that will truly resonate with the intended audience.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                  Additionally, ecommerce and retail are heavily driven by sales and promotional messages as they are B2C businesses with largely low-cost items. As a result, people can be easily drawn in by small deals or discounts. Adding targeted SMS messages into the mix will likely end in resounding success.

                  <h3>Targeted Social Media Marketing </h3>
                  <p>
                  Social media is where targeted digital marketing gets a little complicated but interesting. There isn’t a lot of overarching strategy to it, as the way customers use social media differs greatly between platforms. Yet, it’s important to note that over 40% of consumers use social media for product research. Therefore, social media is the perfect candidate for targeted marketing.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                  On many platforms, such as YouTube, Twitter, or Pinterest, audience targeting will be different. Essentially, for targeting, you can only use the data provided by the platform to deliver digital advertising. You can incorporate internal data into social media marketing in general, however, with targeting, it’s a little different. You’re best off not matching audiences, as social media gives you access to much wider ones.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                  As a result, you might need to approach segments differently. Social media can be used primarily for retargeting (as support for other channels). It can, however, also be used on its own. In these cases, your approach should be to create a combination of demographics and interest in order to reach the intended audience.

                  <h4>Apply Targeted Marketing Campaigns in Practice</h4>
                  <p>
                  Targeted marketing should be included in all digital businesses. Most already do that through the use of PPC advertisements such as Google Ads. However, data can be integrated into other marketing channels in order to take advantage of targeted marketing in those areas.
