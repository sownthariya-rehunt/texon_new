                  <h4>Why use WhatsApp bots?</h4>
                  <p>
                    WhatsApp as a messaging channel has gained popularity
                    amongst today's digital customers. In fact, 67% of consumers
                    prefer using messaging apps when interacting with a
                    business. Deploying chatbot on platforms like WhatsApp
                    enables businesses to assist their customers wherever they
                    are, with ease.
                  </p>
                  <h2>
                    Here are the top 5 reasons, why you should use WhatsApp bots
                    for your business
                  </h2>

                  <h3>1. Reduce Response Time</h3>
                  {/* <Image
                    src="/images/blog/CRM-For-Advertising/crm-definition-graphic.png"
                    alt="CRM-for_advertising-image2"
                    width={865}
                    height={645}
                  /> */}
                  <p>
                    Decreasing response time on WhatsApp via automated messages
                    is key to enhancing customer satisfaction and loyalty. While
                    the WhatsApp business app offers basic automated greeting
                    messages, utilizing chatbots and APIs empowers businesses to
                    craft tailored conversation flows, address common queries,
                    and substantially cut down response times. This not only
                    fosters more meaningful customer engagement but also drives
                    greater brand loyalty and increased spending from satisfied
                    customers.
                  </p>
                 
                  <h3>2. Automate commonly asked questions</h3>
                  <p>
                    As online shopping and bookings surge, FAQs about order
                    confirmation, tracking, cancellation, and refunds skyrocket.
                    Automating these queries is crucial to lighten the load on
                    agents, allowing them to focus on sales. While "Quick
                    Replies" can handle some queries manually, they're limited.
                    WhatsApp chatbot FAQs automate responses for order tracking,
                    cancellations, and more, providing instant, round-the-clock
                    support.

                  </ul> */}
                  <h3>3. Automate product suggestions</h3>
                  <p>
                    When it comes to selling and cross-selling, businesses can
                    streamline the process through WhatsApp bots. Instead of
                    fancy solutions, simply engaging users in conversation and
                    offering tailored suggestions can drive sales. While the
                    native WhatsApp business app's catalog feature allows for
                    this, it requires manual sending and lacks automation.
                    WhatsApp chatbots, however, automate the entire
                    cross-selling flow, from inquiring about interests to
                    guiding checkout, without the need for human intervention.
                    This seamless process enhances user experience and boosts
                    sales potential.
                  </p>

                    width={865}
                    height={645}
                  />
                  <h3>4. Reduce cart abandonment rate</h3>
                  <p>
                    The average cart abandonment rate across all industries is
                    69.57 %. One way to address this is via emails but the open
                    rate of emails is just 13.9%. The open rates to an SMS are
                    as high as 98% and WhatsApp being the most popular messaging
                    app can see even better open rates and can reduce the cart
                    abandonment rate considerably. WhatsApp bots can track items
                    added to the cart and encourage customers to checkout by
                    giving some discounts.
                  </p>
                  <h3>5. Help & Support </h3>
                  <p>
                    Despite all the FAQ databases you build, people will still
                    reach out to the support agents to know about their account
                    details, any active services, the validity of the services
                    or renew their plan. In that case, sending them again to a
                    FAQ section degrades the customer experience. The best way
                    is to provide all the answers automatically on WhatsApp and
                    address any service request then and there. Without WhatsApp
                    bots, providing this great customer experience will require
                    a lot of manual work and can lead to a lot of unaddressed
                    queries.
                  </p>
                  <h4>Conclusion</h4>
                  <p>
                    WhatsApp bots offer an unparalleled opportunity to
                    streamline repetitive tasks, optimize agent productivity,
                    and drive business expansion on the platform.
